As paper is destined to disappear, a digital solution allowing teachers to enter the grades and assessments of their various students becomes essential. National education computers being at the cutting edge of technology, information will be entered only using the keyboard and on 4k screens. Graphical interfaces (web or applications) should be avoided so as not to offend potential colorblind users. To avoid any data leakage, no online management system should be used. All data entered and manipulated in the application must be saved in a text file in JSON format so that it can easily be exchanged on removable media (floppy disk/CD-ROM/USB key).
