As paper is destined to disappear, a digital solution allowing teachers to enter the grades and assessments of their various students becomes essential. National education computers being at the cutting edge of technology, information will be entered only using the keyboard and on 4k screens. All data entered and manipulated in the application must be saved in a text file in JSON format so that it can easily be exchanged on removable media (floppy disk/CD-ROM/USB key).
Menu
When launching the application, a menu will allow the user to choose between these entries:
  Students
  Course
The Students menu will allow you to:
  List students
  Create a new student
  View an existing student
  Add a rating and review for a course on an existing student
  Return to main menu

 The Courses menu will allow you to:

  List existing courses
  Add a new course to the program
  Delete a course by its identifier
  Return to main menu
  The notion of Student
  
The average is information calculated on the fly. You should therefore not save it in the JSON file.
